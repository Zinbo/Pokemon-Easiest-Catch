# Pokemon - Easiest Catch

## What?
I've recently took it upon myself to catch every pokemon.

As I am playing multiple games to catch all the pokemon, I find that I'm constantly looking on pokemon wiki sites to find the best way to get a pokemon.

This app tells you the easiest way to get each pokemon, depending what games you have.

## How to use

## Features
- User can select the games that they own to decide on best game to capture each pokemon
- Will show, in descending order, the best places to catch each pokemon
- User can tick off the pokemon they have for easier viewing, and store details about where they are (in pokemon home, on ruby cartridge, etc.)
- User can filter the list based on:
    - game
        - all pokemon that can be caught in that game
        - pokemon that have the best catch rate in that game
    - ownership
        - pokemon which are already owned by the user
        - pokemon which aren't owned by the user
    - breedable
        - can be currently acquired through breeding of existing pokemon
        - cannot be current acquired through breeding
- Show status page of each pokemon, including how to get its evolutions, e.g. level to 37, hatch from an egg holding Soothe Bell.
- bulk add or remove pokemon from collection
-
